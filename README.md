# Tab Numbers Atom Package [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrodalgaard/atom-tab-numbers.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mrodalgaard/atom-tab-numbers)

> DEPRECATED: This package will no longer be maintained by me since I have switched permanently to VSCode.

Numbers on your Atom tabs for quick jumping (cmd/ctrl + 1..9).

Unobtrusively replacing the tab close icons when not in focus / mouse over.

Also adds a total tabs count to the status bar, which can be disabled via config.
